# Pet Adoption Connect  - Capstone Project
---

## User Stories
As a user, I want to be able to:

- register and login as an adopter or pet owner.
- search and filter through the available pets based on specific criteria, such as breed and location.
- use a messaging system that allows adopters to contact pet owners and vice versa.
-  if I am a pet owner, to add and update information about my pets, and provide a status update when a pet has been adopted.
- make a reservation or appointment request to visit a pet.
- view resources and information on pet adoption, including articles on how to prepare for a new pet, what to expect when adopting a pet, and tips for successful pet-parenting.

Additionally, the website might also have a section for pet rescue organizations and shelters, where they can create profiles and list the pets they have available for adoption.
